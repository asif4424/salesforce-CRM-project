# Phase 9: Reporting, Dashboards & Security (To Do List App)

### Step 1: Create Standard and Custom Reports

1. Employee Task Summary Report  
   - Show tasks assigned, completed, and overdue per employee.

2. Overdue Tasks Report  
   - List tasks past due date and not completed.

3. Task Completion Rate Report  
   - Calculate % completion over time.

4. Priority-Based Task Distribution Report  
   - Show distribution of tasks by priority (Low, Medium, High).

### Step 2: Design Dashboards

1. Create a dashboard for Managers with components:  
   - Pie chart of Task Status (Not Started, In Progress, Completed)  
   - Counter widget showing number of overdue tasks  
   - Bar chart of Priority distribution  
   - Weekly/Monthly task completion trend graphs

2. Share dashboards with Manager profile and admin.

### Step 3: Security Review

1. Profile Permissions  
   - Verify profiles have least privileges for security.  
   - Manager profile: full CRUD on ToDo Task.  
   - Employee profile: read own tasks, edit only status/comments.

2. Sharing Rules  
   - OWD Private for tasks.  
   - Sharing rules to enable Manager visibility for team tasks.

3. Field-Level Security  
   - Protect any sensitive fields by restricting access.

4. Login & Access Policies  
   - Define login hours/IP restrictions if necessary.

### Step 4: Testing & Validation

1. Test reports to ensure data accuracy.  
2. Validate dashboard real-time updates.  
3. Confirm security settings effectively restrict data as intended.
