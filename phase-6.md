1. Open Salesforce Setup → Lightning App Builder.
2. Create a new app page for the To Do List application.
   - Choose a good layout (1 or 2 column).
   - Name the page (e.g., “TaskMaster Dashboard”).



### Step 2: Lightning Pages

1. Create or customize Lightning record pages for ToDo Task.
   - Include key components: Task List, Task Details.
2. Assign page layouts for different profiles:
   - Employee layout: focused, simple view (tasks assigned to them).
   - Manager layout: includes extra components (team summary or charts).



### Step 3: Lightning Web Components (LWC)

1. Develop custom LWC components for enhanced UI:
   - **Task List Component:** Shows all tasks in a table/list.
   - **Task Creation Form:** Allows users to quickly create a new task.
   - **Dashboard Charts:** Pie chart for task status, bar chart for priorities.
   - **Quick Actions:** Complete, edit, or comment on tasks directly from the list.

2. Deploy LWC on Lightning record pages or in the app page for interactive views.

### Step 4: Navigation & Tabs

1. Create custom tabs for easy navigation:
   - “My Tasks”
   - “Team Tasks” (Manager only)
   - “Dashboard”

2. Add these tabs to the TaskMaster app so users see only what they need.


### Step 5: Mobile Optimization

1. Test Lightning pages and LWCs in Salesforce mobile app.
2. Adjust layouts/components for mobile-friendly display.



### Step 6: User Testing

1. Share the app with test employee and manager users.
2. Gather feedback on usability and fix UI bugs or issues.
